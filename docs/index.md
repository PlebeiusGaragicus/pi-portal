# pi-portal

**pi-portal** is a local web UI for managing **[dot-mi](https://github.com/PlebeiusGaragicus/dot-mi)** **standalone agents** (`agents/<name>/`): browse agents, edit `SYSTEM.md`, `pi-args`, and optional prompt files, add or remove symlinks to shared extensions and skills, and create or delete agents (aligned with `./setup.sh create-agent`).

## Scope

**v1** covers **standalone agents only**. Teams under `teams/` are not managed in this UI.
